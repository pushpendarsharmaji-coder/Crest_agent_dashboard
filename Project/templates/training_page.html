    <h3>Concept of insurance</h3>
    <p>
        Each asset has a financial value and is procured to provide certain
        benefits. The benefit can be in the form of direct income or
        comfort and convenience. Assets may be ‘tangible’ or ‘intangible’.
        Human beings, house, furniture, vehicle, property etc. are tangible
        assets. Liability, goodwill, fair deal, voice of a singer, employee’s
        honesty etc. are examples of intangible assets. Insurance covers
        both tangible and intangible assets. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Insurance is a system by which risk is transferred by a
        person, business or an organization to an insurance
        company, which reimburses the insured for the covered
        losses. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A few insured who suffer losses are paid out of the premiums paid
        by the many. Thus spreading of risks or pooling of risks is the basis
        of insurance operations.
        <h3>How insurance works?</h3>
        Persons exposed to the same risk come together and agree that if
        anyone of them suffers a loss the others will share the same.
        <h5>Example: if one farmer’s cow dies due to accident or sickness, all
        the farmers in the village contribute to share the loss and help the
        farmer financially to purchase another cow.</h5>
        Different type of risks can be identified and a sufficiently large
        group of similar risks can be formed. A fund can be created out of
        contributions by the members of this group.
        In practice this fund is managed by an Insurance Company
        (Insurer). The amount an insurance company collects as expected
        contribution from the group members (Insured) in advance to
        create the fund is called Premium. From this fund, they pay to the
        person who suffers a loss. 
    </p>

</div>

<div class="sub-tab-content" id="Purpose and need of insurance">
    <h3>Purpose and need of insurance </h3>
    <p>
        The purpose of Insurance is to create a system through which a
        fund is created. This fund is based on the pooling principle. The
        fund is utilized for providing compensation to the few who suffer
        losses.
        <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li> An office manager may suffer loss due to fire in his house. He
        needs insurance for his house and household goods.</li>
        <li> A shopkeeper may need insurance for his shop</li>
        <li> A family needs insurance on the life of its breadwinner.</li>
        <li> A teacher may need insurance for medical expenses.</li>
        <li> A farmer needs insurance for his crop.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
</div>

<div class="sub-tab-content" id="Concepts of Risk, Peril and Hazard">
    <h3>Concepts of Risk, Peril and Hazard</h3>
    <p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        The term ‘risk’ refers to a situation of uncertain possibility of loss or
        damage. Only uncertain risks are covered by insurance.

        <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><strong>Peril:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        Causes of loss is called "Peril". An asset is likely to be lost,
        destroyed or damaged due to certain accidental occurrences such
        as fire, floods, theft, earthquake and so many other mishappenings like these. These likely mis-happenings are called
        ‘perils’.

        <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><strong>Hazard:</strong></li>
        </ul>
        Mere exposure to a peril need not cause a loss. Again, a loss need
        not be severe. The condition or conditions which increase the
        probability of a loss or its severity, and thus impact(s) the risk is
        known as hazard. When insurers make an assessment of the risk, it
        is generally with reference to the hazards to which the asset is
        subject.

        3. Bancassurance<br>
        4. Insurance Brokers</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Micro Insurance Agents:</strong> Micro Insurance Agents are allowed to do
        only micro insurance business both in life and non-life insurance.<br><br>

        company or an insurance intermediary
 
   </p>
</div>
<div class="sub-tab-content" id="Point of Sales Person (POSP)">
    <h3>Role of Point of Sales Person (POSP)</h3>
    <p>
        POSP is an individual who possesses the minimum qualifications,
        has undergone training and passed the examination as specified in
        IRDAI guidelines and solicits and markets only certain preunderwritten products approved
        by the IRDAI.<br><br>
        As per the regulator, products such as motor insurance, travel
        insurance and personal accident insurance require very little
        underwriting as they are based on information provided by the
        prospect. Also, such insurance policies are automatically generated
        by the system.<br><br>
        Therefore, the intervention required for such products is minimal
        and the training and exams for such persons could be of a lesser
        degree than those for a full-fledged distributor.<br><br>
        To start with, POSP Guidelines were issued by the IRDAI on
        26th October 2015 to cover Point of Sales Persons - Non-Life and
        Health Insurance.<br><br>
        In November, 2016 IRDAI allowed the life insurance industry to use
        point of sales person to sell life insurance products also. It
        identified products that are simple to understand, and in which the
        benefits are stated upfront and they are fixed and predefined.<br><br>
        
        Accordingly, IRDAI identified pure-term insurance plans with and
        without return of premium, non-linked (non-participating)
        endowment plans that state the investment benefits upfront and
        immediate annuity as products that can be sold by the point of
        sales person.<br><br>
        In February, 2017 in order to ensure faster certification of point of
        sales person in the life insurance space, the regulator has relaxed
        the certification programme by allowing the insurers or
        intermediaries hiring them to train and examine these individuals
        in-house.<br><br>
        <strong>There are two types of persons who can solicit and market insurance policies namely:</strong><br><br> 
        1. Insurance agent or specified persons of corporate agent or
        broker trained persons for soliciting and marketing
        insurance policies or insurance sales persons of Insurance
        Marketing Firm or rural authorised persons of Common
        Service Centre (CSC) or authorised person of web
        aggregators who can solicit and market all types of
        insurance policies. <br>
        2. “Point of Sales Person” who can solicit and market only
            certain pre-underwritten products approved by the
            Authority. <br><br>
        <strong>Specialist Intermediaries:</strong><br><br>
        1. Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors<br>
        2. Claim Investigators<br>
        3. Medical Examiners<br>
        4. Third Party Administrators (TPA) <br>

    <strong>Offer and Acceptance:</strong><br><br>
    Offer is made by the prosper and acceptance is made by the insurer. If any condition is put it becomes a counter offer. The
    policy bond becomes the evidence of the contract.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Consideration (Premium)</strong><br><br>
    <strong>Premium</strong> is the consideration from the insured, and the promise to indemnify, is the consideration from the insurer.
    <br><strong>Same mind (Consensus ad-idem)</strong>—Both insurer and insured must
    agree on the same thing in the same manner.<br>
    <strong>Free Consent</strong>— There should be free consent while entering into a
    contract. Consent is said to be free if it is not caused by coercion,
    undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. When
    consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or
    misrepresentation, the agreement is voidable.<br><br>Consent is said to be free if it is not caused by:<br><br>
    (a) Coercion — It applies pressure applied through criminal means.<br>
    (b) Undue influence—when a person who is able to dominate the
    will of another uses his position to obtain an undue advantage over
    the other.<br>
    (c) Fraud—when a person induces another to act on a false belief
    that is caused by a representation he does not believe to be true. It
    can arise either from deliberate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concealment of facts or through
    misrepresenting them.<br>
    (d) Mistake—Error in one’s knowledge or belief or interpretation
    of a thing or event. This can be lead to an error in understanding
    and agreement about the subject matter of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract.<br>
    Capacity of the parties — The policyholder should be major and of
    sound mind and not disqualified under law. Both the parties should
    be legally competent.<br>
    Legality— The object of the contract must be legal.

<div class="sub-tab-content" id="Insurable Interest">
    <h3>Special features of Insurance Contracts:</h3>
    <p><strong>Insurable interest</strong> — is an essential ingredient of every insurance
    contract and is considered as legal pre-requisite for insurance. It
    relates to the financial interest in the property to be insured. One’s
    insurable interest can be in self (one life), Spouse’s life, Children life
    and Assets owned. <br><br>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/partners/insurable_interest.png') }}"
     alt="Offer and Acceptance"
     style="width:300px; display:block; margin:10px auto; border-radius:6px;"><br><br>
     In life insurance insurable interest must be present at the time of
    taking the policy. In general insurance insurable interests should be
    present at the time of taking the policy as well as at the time of
    claim except for marine cargo policies, where it must be present at
    the time of loss<br><br>
    <strong>Uberrima Fides or Utmost Good Faith :</strong><br><br>
    It means every party to the contract must disclose all material facts relating to the subject matter of insurance.It is defined as involving “a  positive duty to voluntarily 
    disclose, accurately and fully, all facts material to the risk being proposed, whether requested or not.” If utmost good faith is not observed by
    either party, the contract may be avoided by the other.<br><br>

    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/partners/insurable_interest2.png') }}"
     alt="Offer and Acceptance"
     style="width:300px; display:block; margin:10px auto; border-radius:6px;"><br><br>
    <strong>Material Facts</strong> — It has been defined as a fact that would affect the
    judgment of an insurance underwriter in deciding whether to
    accept the risk and if so, the rate of premium and the terms and
    conditions.<br>
    <strong>Facts that need not be disclosed</strong> - It is also held that unless there is
    a specific enquiry by underwriters, the proposer has no obligation
    to disclose the following facts:<br><br>
    1. Measures implemented to reduce the risk. Example: The
    presence of a fire extinguisher.<br>
    2. Facts which the insured does not know or is unaware of
    Example: An individual, who suffers from high blood
    pressure but was unaware about the same at the time of
    taking the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy, cannot be charged with nondisclosure of
    this fact.<br>
    3. Which could be discovered, by reasonable diligence
    (Common Knowledge) Example: It is not necessary to
    disclose every minute material fact. The underwriters must
    be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conscious enough to ask for the same if they require
    further information.It is also held that unless there is a specific enquiry by
    underwriters, the proposer has no obligation to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disclose.<br>
    4. Matters of law: Everybody is supposed to know the law of
    the land. Example: Municipal laws about storing of
    explosives.<br>
    5. About which insurer appears to be indifferent (or has
    waived the need for further information). The insurer
    cannot later disclaim responsibility on grounds that the
    answers were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incomplete<br><br>
    <strong>Indemnity:</strong> The object of the principle of indemnity is to place the
    insured after a loss in the same financial position, as far as possible,
    as he occupied immediately before the loss. The effect of the
    principle is to prevent the insured from making a profit out of his
    loss.<br><br>
    <strong>Subrogation:</strong> The principle of subrogation may be defined as the
    transfer of rights and remedies of the insured to the insurer who
    has indemnified the insured in respect of the loss.<br><br>
    <strong>Contribution:</strong> The principle of contribution is defined as the right of
    insurers who have paid a loss under a policy to recover a
    proportionate amount from other insurers who are liable for the
    same loss.<br><br>
    It is important to note that the principles of ‘subrogation‘ and
    ‘contribution‘ do not apply in personal accident policies as these
    are not contracts of indemnity<br>
    According to IRDAI Health Insurance Regulations 2013, insurers can
    not insist on contribution clause before settling a claim.<br><br>
    <strong>Proximate Cause:</strong> ‘Proximate Cause‘refers to the event that proves
    to be the dominant cause and there is a direct link between it and
    the resultant loss. Proximate Cause is important because when it
    comes to establishing the cause of a loss, and whether it is covered
    under the insurance contract, we need to look at the dominant
    cause of the loss. 
    </p>

</div>
<div class="sub-tab-content" id="Proposal Form">
    <h3>Proposal Form:</h3>
    <p>The proposal form contains questions designed to elicit all material
    information about the particular risk proposed for insurance.<br><br>
    ✔ who he/she is<br>
    ✔ what kind of insurance he/she needs<br>
    ✔ details of what he/she wants to insure and<br>
    ✔ for what period of time<br>
    ✔details of previous insurance and claims<br><br>
    Details would mean the monetary value of the subject matter of
    insurance and all material facts connected with the proposed
    insurance.<br><br>
    The proposal form includes a Declaration where the insured
    declares that the answers are true and accurate and that he agrees
    that the proposal form shall be the basis of the insurance contract.
    Any wrong answer will give the right to the insurer to avoid the
    contract.<br>
    <h3>Sales Literature:</h3>
    As per IRDAI, specific disclosures have to be made in sales
    literature, especially features like there are two insurers involved,
    that each risk is distinct from the other, who will settle claims,
    matters relating to renewability of both or only one of the covers
    at the option of the insured, servicing facilities etc.
    Insurers have also to clearly draw the attention of the policyholder
    in the policy contract and sales literature that:<br>
    (a) All health insurance policies are portable;<br>
    (b) Policyholder should initiate action to approach another insurer,
    to take advantage of portability, well before the renewal date to avoid any break in the policy coverage due to delays in
    acceptance of the proposal by the other insurer.<br><br>
    IRDAI has cautioned members of the public not to get carried away
    by unapproved sales presentations being circulated in the market.
    They may take an informed decision while purchasing a policy, on
    the basis of proper disclosures by the licensed representatives of
    the insurer. 
    <h4>Renewal Notice: </h4>
    Most of the non-life insurance policies are issued on annual basis.
    There is no legal obligation on the part of insurers to advise the
    insured that his policy is due to expire on a particular date.
    However, as a matter of courtesy and healthy business practice,
    insurers issue a renewal notice in advance of the date of expiry,
    inviting renewal of the policy. It is also the practice to include a
    note advising the insured that he should intimate any material
    alterations in the risk. 
    <h4>Premium Payment Options: </h4>
    Non-life policies are generally issued for one year and full premium
    is to be paid in advance before commencement of risk.
    Premium payment to an insurer by a person seeking insurance or
    by the policyholder may be made in any one or more of the
    following methods –<br><br>
    1. Cash<br>
    2. Any recognised banking negotiable instrument such as
    cheques, demand drafts, pay order, banker’s cheques drawn on
    any schedule bank in India;<br>
    3. Postal money order;<br>
    4. Credit or debit cards;<br>
    5. Net Banking / E-transfer<br>
    6. Direct credits via standing instruction of proposer or the
    policyholder or the insured through bank transfers; <br><br>
    As per IRDAI Regulations, in case the proposer / policyholder opts
    for premium payment through net banking or credit / debit card,
    the payment must be made only through net banking account or
    credit / debit card issued in the name of such proposer /
    policyholder.
    <h4>Section 64VB the Insurance Act, 1938: </h4>
    No risk to be assumed unless premium is received in advance:—<br><br>
    1. No insurer shall assume any risk in India in respect of any
    insurance business on which premium is not ordinarily
    payable outside India unless and until the premium payable
    is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such
    person in such manner and within such time as may be
    prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as
    may be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prescribed, is made in advance in the prescribed
    manner.<br><br>
    2. Where the premium is tendered by postal money order or
    cheque sent by post, the risk may be assumed on the date
    on which the money order is booked or the cheque is
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posted, as the case may be.<br><br>
    3. Any refund of premium which may become due to an
    insured on account of the cancellation of a policy or
    alteration in its terms and conditions or otherwise shall be
    paid by the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insurer directly to the insured by a crossed or
    order cheque or by postal money order and a proper
    receipt shall be obtained by the insurer from the insured,
    and such refund shall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in no case be credited to the account
    of the agent.<br><br>
    4. Where an insurance agent collects a premium on a policy of
    insurance on behalf of an insurer, he shall deposit with, or
    despatch by post to, the insurer, the premium so collected
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in full without deduction of his commission within twentyfour hours of the collection excluding bank and postal
    holidays.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="sub-tab-content active" id="Policy Terms and Conditions">
    <h4>Conditions:</h4>
    <p>
        A condition is a provision in an insurance contract which forms the
        basis of the agreement. Breach of a condition makes the policy
        voidable at the option of the insurer.<br><br>
        For example –<br><br>
        One of the standard conditions in most insurance policies states –
        If the claim be in any respect fraudulent, or if any false declaration
        be made or used in support thereof or if any fraudulent means or
        devices are used by the Insured or any one acting on his behalf to
        obtain any benefit under the policy or if the loss or damage be
        occasioned by the Wilful Act, or with the connivance of the
        Insured, all benefits under this policy shall be forfeited.<br><br>
        The Claim Intimation condition in a Health policy may state –
        Claim must be filed within certain days from date of discharge from
        the Hospital. However, waiver of this Condition may be considered
        in extreme cases of hardship where it is proved to the satisfaction
        of the Company that under the circumstances in which the insured
        was placed it was not possible for him or any other person to give
        such notice or file claim within the prescribed time-limit.
        <h4>Warranties:</h4>
        ‘Warranty’ is a condition expressly stated in the policy which has to
        be literally complied with for validity of the contract.
        Warranty is not a separate document. It is part of the policy
        document. It is a condition precedent to (which operates prior to
        other terms of) the contract. It must be observed and complied
        with strictly and literally, whether or not it is material to the risk.<br><br>
        With a warranty, the insured undertakes certain obligations that
        need to be complied within a certain period of time and also during
        the policy period. Liability of the insurer depends on the insured’s
        compliance with these obligations. Warranties play an essential
        role in managing and improving the risk.<br><br>
        Warranties are meant to limit the liability of the insurer under
        certain circumstances. Insurers also include warranties in a policy
        to reduce the hazard.
        <h4>Endorsement:</h4>
        Endorsements are meant to effect amendments / changes in policy
        document. If certain terms and conditions of the policy need to be
        changed at the time of issuance, it is done by way of endorsement.
        It is attached to the policy and forms a part of it. The policy and the
        endorsement together make up the contract.
        Endorsements may also be issued during the currency of the policy
        to record changes / amendments.
        <h4>Section 41 of Insurance Act, 1938:</h4>
        <h4>Prohibition of Rebates:</h4>
        (1) No person shall allow or offer to allow, either directly or
        indirectly, as an inducement to any person to take out or renew or
        continue an insurance in respect of any kind of risk relating to lives
        or property in India, any rebate of the whole or part of the
        commission payable or any rebate of the premium shown on the
        policy, nor shall any person taking out or renewing or continuing a
        policy accept any rebate, except such rebate as may be allowed in
        accordance with the published prospectuses or tables of the
        insurer;<br><br>
        (2) Any person making default in complying with the provisions of
        this section shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five
        hundred rupees.

        style="width:300px; display:block; margin:10px auto; border-radius:6px;"><br><br>
    <strong>Claim Intimation:</strong><br><br>
    When the insured event occurs, a claim for payment of loss arises.
    While in few policies, there is a specific time limit for intimating the
    claim, all policies state that intimation be sent to the insurer
    immediately.<br><br>
    There are two stages of claim settlements:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claims Investigation and<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claim Assessment<br><br>
    Investigation tries to determine the validity of the claim whereas
    assessment is more concerned with the cause and extent of the
    loss.
    <h4>Survey Report: </h4>
    As laid down in the Insurance Act, 1938, if the amount of loss is Rs
    20,000/- or more, a licensed Surveyor is to be appointed to assess
    the loss. Surveyor has to be appointed within 72 hours by the
    insurance company. Surveyor would visit the site of happening and
    submit his report to the insurer including therein –<br><br>
    ✔ Cause of loss<br>
    ✔ Quantum of the loss<br>
    ✔ Comments about policy conditions to be followed<br>
    ✔ Comments about admissibility of claim and compliance of
    terms and conditions of the policy by the insured.
    In marine branch, the Surveyor’s fee is initially borne by the
    insured. It &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is reimbursed if the insurer accepts the claim.<br><br>
    <h4>First Information Report (FIR):</h4>
    First information report is information to police authorities
    generally regarding –<br><br>
    ✔ Major vehicular accident injuring third parties or damaging<br>
    ✔ Theft, burglary or housebreaking cases
    their properties<br>
    ✔ Fire incident involving injuries to any persons or causing
    major property loss<br>
    ✔ Cases involving financial frauds by employees or others
    cause of loss to the insured<br>
    ✔ Death of an individual due to accident
    From the insurer’s point, FIR is the document which gives
    information about the intimation of crime, circumstances and likely
    cause of loss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and likely persons involved and approximate value of
    loss. 
    <h4>Death Certificate and Post Mortem Report:</h4>
    Death Certificate is required for claim under personal accident and
    health insurance policies. It is also required in case of cattle or
    other animal insurances. Death certificate relating to humans is
    issued by Municipality or Gram Panchayat of the area in which the
    deceased was residing or died. For cattle and animals, it is issued
    by a veterinary surgeon treating the animal or who attended it at
    the time of the death. Post Mortem Report (PMR) is examination of
    dead body, generally conducted in accidental or doubtful deaths,
    for testing various organs to find out the cause of death. The post
    mortem is performed at government or local body’s hospital. In
    case of insurance of animals post mortem report is required, which
    is conducted by a veterinary surgeon.
    <h4>Specific Documents in addition the claim form:</h4>
    <h4>Motor Insurance Claims:</h4>
    ✔ Estimate of repairs, repair bills<br>
    ✔ Survey report<br>
    ✔ Vehicle documents<br>
    ✔ FIR in case of theft of vehicle or injury or damage to a third
    party/ property<br>
    <h4>Cattle Insurance claims:</h4>
    ✔ Death Certificate on insurance company’s form.
    In case of death of animal insured under Integrated Rural
    Development Programme (IRDP) or other similar scheme,
    death certificate may be issued by Panchayats.<br>
    ✔ Post mortem report.<br>
    ✔ Ear tag.<br>
    ✔ Valuation certificate by veterinary doctor.<br>
    ✔ In case of claims for disablement veterinary doctor’s
    certificate with treatment details.<br>

    <h3>Motor Insurance</h3>
    <p>
    Must be taken by a vehicle owner of a vehicle plying on public
    roads whose vehicle is registered in her / his name with the
    Regional Transport Authority in India;<br><br>
    Under The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it is mandatory for every
    owner of a vehicle plying on public roads, to take an insurance
    policy, to cover the amount, which the owner becomes legally
    liable to pay as damages to third parties as a result of
    accidental death, bodily injury or damage to property.
    A certificate of Insurance must be carried in the vehicle as a proof
    of such insurance.

    An insurance policy purchased for protection against the legal
    actions of another party. Purchased by the insured (first party)
    from an insurance company (second party) for protection against
    another party's claims (third party) for liability arising out of the
    action of the insured is called "Liability Insurance" as well as two
    popular and important types of covers:

     style="width:500px; display:block; margin:20px auto; border-radius:40px;"><br><br>
    The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 defines the “health
    insurance business as contracts which provide for sickness benefits 
    or medical, surgical or hospital expense benefits, whether inpatient or out-patient, travel cover and personal accident cover.”
    Each insurance company has designed products of its own to meet
    the customer demand. Uniformity therein may not be possible, but
    the coverage and main features are similar.
    <h4>Hospitalization Insurance Policy:</h4>
    Popularly known as ‘Mediclaim’, the hospitalization policy covers
    medical expenses of treatment of in-patients (persons hospitalized
    for minimum 24 hours) with some additional features.
    <h4>Coverage:</h4>
    ✔ Room and board charges<br><br>
    ✔ Consultants’, surgeons’, anaesthetists’ fees, including that
    of nurses etc.<br><br>
    ✔ Blood transfusion, medicines, lab tests and other
    investigations<br><br>
    ✔ Operation theatre, anaesthesia, artificial limbs etc.<br><br>
    ✔ Ambulance Charges for a specified amount 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="sub-tab-content active" id="Special Features of the Policy">
    <h3>Special Features of the Policy:</h3>
    <p>
    <h4>24 hours hospitalization in the Hospital:</h4>
    To avail the claim, the insured has to stay in a registered nursing
    home/ hospital for a minimum of 24 hours.
    <h4>Day Care Treatment:</h4>
    There are certain diseases like cataract, dialysis, chemotherapy,
    radiotherapy etc. the treatment of which does not require 24 hours
    hospitalization. These come under ‘Day care treatment’.
    <h4>Domiciliary Hospitalization:</h4>
    According to this feature, the insured can get the claim while being
    treated at home, provided the following conditions are met;<br><br>
    ✔ The Patient is so critical that he cannot be taken to a
    hospital<br><br>
    ✔ No bed is available in the hospital where the treating doctor
    is visiting. However, there is a ‘waiting period’ of 3 days for
    this feature.
    <h4>Pre and Post Hospitalization Charges:</h4>
    ✔ <strong>Pre hospitalization expenses</strong> could be in the form of tests,
    medicines, doctors’ fees etc. Such expenses are relevant
    and pertaining to the hospitalization are covered under the
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health policies.<br><br>
    ✔ <strong>Post hospitalization expenses:</strong> After stay in the hospital, in
    most cases there would be expenses related to recovery
    and follow-up.Generally 30 days pre hospitalization and 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days post
    hospitalization are covered. However, this may vary from company
    to company.
    <h4>Cumulative Bonus:</h4>
    Cumulative Bonus means an increase in the sum assured granted
    by the insurer without an associated increase in premium.
    It was the practice to provide incentive to clients to renew the
    policy for which purpose the insurance company would give
    additional sum insured of 5% free of cost at the time of claim free
    renewal upto certain maximum say 30% or 50%.<br><br>
    Health Insurance Regulations 2013 provide that insurers may offer
    cumulative bonus on indemnity based health insurance policies,
    which shall be stated explicitly in the Prospectus and the Policy
    document.<br><br>
    If a claim is made in any particular year, the cumulative bonus
    accrued may be reduced at the same rate at which it is accrued.
    Cumulative Bonus is not allowed on benefit based policies.
    <h4>Who can take the Policy?</h4>

    ✔ Members of a family on a floater basis (spouse, two
    children below the age of 25 years and parents)<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entire group of individuals.
    <h4>Age Limit:</h4>
    The eligibility varies from insurer to insurer, from as young as 3
    months to 80 years and above. Some companies have no limit for
    age at entry. All companies have to provide lifelong renewals as per
    IRDA Regulations.

    insured for pre-existing conditions and time bound 
    exclusions if the policy holder chooses to switch from one 
    insurer to another or from one plan of the same insurer, 
    provided the previous policy has been maintained without 
    any break.<br><br>
    • A break in policy occurs when the premium due on a given 
    policy is not paid on or before the premium renewal date or 
    within 30 days thereof.<br><br> 
    • Portability ensures that when a policyholder changes his 
    health insurance policy from one insurance company to 
    another, he does not lose the benefits he has accumulated. 
    <h4>Cashless Facility:</h4> 
    Insurance Companies have tie up 
    arrangements with network of hospitals. If a 
    policyholder takes treatment in any of these 
    hospitals, there is no need for the insured 
    person to pay the hospital bills. The 
    insurance company through its Third Party 
    Administrator (TPA) will arrange direct payment to the hospital.

        provide full insured amount to the farmers against crop loss
        in any natural calamities.<br><br>
        👉 There is no upper limit on Government subsidy. Even if
        balance premium is 90%, it will be borne by the
        Government.<br><br>
        👉 Earlier, there was a provision of capping the premium rate
        which is low claims being paid to farmers. Now this is
        removed and farmers will get claim against full sum insured
        without any reduction.<br><br>
        👉 The use of technology will be encouraged to a great extent.
        Smart phones, Remote sensing drone and GPS technologies
        will be used to capture and upload data of crop cutting to
        reduce the delays in the claim payment.<br><br>
        👉 Allocation of the scheme presented in budget 2016-2017 is
        Rs.5,550 crores.<br><br>
        👉 The insurance plan will be handled under s single insurance
        company, Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC).<br><br>
        👉 PMFBY is a replacement scheme of National Agriculture
        Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and Modified National Agriculture
        Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and hence exempted from the
        service tax.<br><br>
        <h4>Objectives of the Scheme:</h4>
        i. to provide insurance coverage and financial support to the
        farmers in the event of failure of any of the notified crop as
        a result of natural calamities, pests and diseases;<br>
        ii. to stabiles the income of farmers to ensure their continuous
        process in farming;<br>
        iii. to encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern
        agricultural practices;<br>
        iv. to ensure flow of credit to the agriculture sector.
        <h4>Coverage of Risk:</h4>
        Following states of the crop and risks leading to crop loss are
        covered under the scheme.<br><br>
        👉 <strong>Prevented Sowing / Planting Risk:</strong> insured area is
        prevented from sowing planting due to deficit rainfall or
        adverse seasonal conditions;<br>
        👉 <strong>Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting):</strong> comprehensive risk
        insurance is provided to cover yield losses due to nonpreventable risks, viz. drought, dry spells, flood, inundation,
        pests and diseases, landslides, natural fire and lightening, storm, hailstorm, cyclone, typhoon, tempest, hurricane and
        tornado.<br>
        👉 <strong>Post-Harvest Losses:</strong> coverage is available only up to a
        maximum period of two weeks from harvesting for those
        crops which are allowed to dry in cut and spread condition
        in the field after harvesting against specific perils of cyclone
        and cyclonic rains and unseasonal rains.<br>
        👉 <strong>Localized Calamities:</strong> Loss/damage resulting from
        occurrence of identified localized risks of hailstorm,
        landslide and inundation affecting isolated farms in the
        notified area.<br><br>
        <h4>Area Approach Basis:</h4>
        The scheme shall be implemented on an "Area Approach Basis"
        (i.e. defined areas) for each notified crop for widespread
        calamities. The assumption that all the insured farmers, in a Unit of
        Insurance, should be defined as "Notified Area" for a crop, face
        similar risk exposures, incur to a large extent, identical cost of
        production per hectare, earn comparable farm income per hectare,
        and experience similar extent of crop loss due to the operation of
        an insured peril, in the notified area. The unit of insurance can be
        demographically mapped with region having homogenous risk
        profile for the notified crop.<br>
        For risks of localized calamities and post-harvest losses on account
        of defined peril, the unit of insurance for loss assessment shall be
        the affected insured field of the individual farmer.
